In this challenge I created a calendar app. The user can write in appointments and the time blocks are color coded. 

Originally, I had created the time blocks directly in the HTML, but changed it when I realized that it made the code harder to work with. Changing it also allowed me to utilize jQuery, which was part of the assignment.
